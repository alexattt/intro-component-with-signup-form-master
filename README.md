# Frontend Mentor challenge - Intro component with signup form

<p>
  My version of Intro component with signup form for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used HTML, CSS and JS to implement simple form validation. Component is responsive.</p>
